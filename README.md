npm i

# 2. Generate a use-case folder with Cursor or Claude
# Simply provide your use-case document to an AI assistant and ask it to generate the mockups

# 3. Start the development server and capture screenshots
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## How to Use

2. **Generate Mockups**: Use Cursor or Claude to generate a use-case folder by providing your use-case document to the AI
3. **View and Capture**: Run `npm run dev` to start the server, then use the "Capture Screenshot" button to save mockups as PNG files
